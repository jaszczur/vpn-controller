VPN Controller
==============

An application to manage local VPN connection.

*WARNING* It was created in order to check out Spring Boot and Project Reactor. Currently
it is strictly tailored for my environment and has very limited functionality.

TODO list
---------

In order of importance:
* Gather all vpn provider related facts in a single adapter
* Implement country switching
* Write a shell script for interacting with the controller
* Remove hardcodes for specific vpn provider
* Implement simple GUI
